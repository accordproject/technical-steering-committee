## Recap
- We used to us DocuSign based signup process for AP

  - We could likely use the Linux Foundation payment gateway (Community Bridge)
- Unsure how to associate money in Community Bridge to a credit card for spending
  - As soon as we have an account, we can set up GitHub sponsorship
- Completed Netlify badge for OSS
- Matt Roberts found a transition of hosting for accordproject.org will be smooth ($29/mo)
- Hooking GitHub to Community Bridge (look into Open Collective)
- Follow up with Peter Hunn on 1password, Google, Slack, Vimeo, Zoom for OSS
- Update credit card associated with DocuSign
- Follow up on Netlify OSS account

## Notes
- Netlify badge is on the AP site, should be approved for OSS account
- 1Password should be populated and everyone with access
