## Agenda

### Standardise approach to CI/CD [Issue #4](https://github.com/accordproject/technical-steering-committee/issues/4)
- Accord currently uses two CI/CD tools 
	- [https://travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) 
	- [https://circleci.com](https://circleci.com)
- At the monent, most Accord Project projects on Travis. 
- Ergo compiler uses CircleCI because it needs a longer build time.
- No crisis - nothing needs to be done at the moment.
- Would be quite a bit of work to change due to the many deployment scripts Accord uses.
- Github Actions has the benefit of being integrated with Github and using it would mean one less system dependency.
- Would require some investigation to determine if Accord can use Github Actions or not.
- Mainly to see if the scripts can be ported and if Github actions would support the longer build times required by the Ergo compiler.
- _**ACTION**_ - Jerome volunteered to do a little bit of research prior to the next TSC meeting and will share findings.

### Standardise approach to static site hosting [Issue #5](https://github.com/accordproject/technical-steering-committee/issues/5) 

- Clause.io currently hosting of the following static sites on Netlify:
	- [https://models.accordproject.org](https://models.accordproject.org)
	- [https://templates.accordproject.org](https://templates.accordproject.org)
	- [https://ap-web-components.netlify.app](https://templates.accordproject.org)
	- [http://docs.accordprojec.org](https://templates.accordproject.org)
- Netlify do offer an open source plan
- Need to migrate these sites from Clause.io
- Accord Project is happy with Netlify as the provider and costs are minimal.
- Motivation is to decouple Clause.io and Accord Project infrastructure. 
- Currently no budget or money allocated to pay for infrastructure costs.
- Funding and budget processes need to be formalised by Accord Project Governing Board, so that the Accord Project can independently manage its overheads.
- Currently an open proposal which has not been actioned yet.
- _**ACTION**_ - Dan volunteered to liaise with Peter Hunn to obtain Netlify open-source account details.
- _**ACTION**_ - Antonis volunteered to work with Dan to determine the total cost overheads for the Accord Project, to determine the minimum running costs for the project and investigate if the Accord Project can have an independent bank account.

### Hosting for Accord Project Web Site [Issue #6](https://github.com/accordproject/technical-steering-committee/issues/6)

- Currently AccordProject.org hosted on the Wordpress.com "as a service".
- Wordpress.com hosting fees currently being paid by Clause.io. 
- These fees need to be included in infrastructure running costs and paid for by the Accord Project too.
- Wordpress.com is functionally rich and enables easy authoring of content.  However, it comes with a maintenance overhead due to complexity and none of the current maintainers / contributors having PHP skills.
- Would be a huge project to migrate AccordProject.org from WordPress to some other content management / site generation system.  Not a priority at the moment.
- Main priority would be to separate billing from Clause.io - (include in above Action items). 
 
### Incubation process for new projects [Issue #12](https://github.com/accordproject/technical-steering-committee/issues/12) 

- Nikolay Vlasov [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/frbrkoala) has developed some sample code to execute Accord Project components on a serverless architecture with AWS Lambda and Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) services.
- Nikolay has generously offered the code - [accord-qldb-lambda](https://github.com/frbrkoala/accord-qldb-lambda) - to the Accord Project.
- Discussed best way to bring this codebase into Accord Project and agreed to instigate a "Incubation Lab" process - similar to the Apache Labs concept.
- An Incubation Lab allows the Accord Project to determine if there is genuine community interest.
- An Incubation Lab also helps set community expectation regarding the support for the codebase.
- Discussed that there has to be some sort of exit criteria for an Incubation Lab to graduate to being part of the Accord Project.
- One criteria will be finding a suitable Maintainer for the codebase.
- Another criteria could be how to abstract certain components to be vemdor agnostic.
- In addition, Nikolay has licensed the code under the MIT license agreement, whereas all Accord Project source is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license agreement.  
- Agreed that license for contributed code would need to be changed to Apache 2.0 in order to align with the other code repositories within the Accord Project.
- As this is a significant code contribution then agreed to have Nikolay sign a Developer Certificate of Originality (DCO).
- Discussed pros and cons of having an AWS-specific code contribution.
- Agreed that this is a good thing, as allows AWS users to deploy Accord Project library to AWS infrastructure more easily.
- However, agreed that Accord Project needs to stay vendor agnostic and encourage deployment of Accord Project to other cloud-based infrastructure providers.
- _**ACTION**_ - Martin to followup with Nikolay about switching code to using Apache 2.0 license.
- _**ACTION**_ - Martin to followup with Nikolay about signing DCO.
- _**ACTION**_ - Jerome to create a Github "Incubation Lab" repository, and provide some of "list" of criteria to be completed prior to Nikolay's initial commit.
- _**ACTION**_ - Martin to liaise with Nikolay with contributing his code, and to create an additional issue to capture "Exit Criteria" for Incubation Lab. 

### Identity management and digital certs [Issue #13](https://github.com/accordproject/technical-steering-committee/issues/13)

- Broad discussion on Accord Project templates versus contract instances.  
- Agreed that we do not want to be wedded to any specific digital signing tecnology.
- However, the concept of being able to encapsulate all logic, data, text and assets within an Accord Project contract instance is a compelling one.
- Discussion about whether this is "core" to Accord Project - which has traditionally been around binding models to text and the expressivity of the Ergo language.
- Argument that Accord Project templates are not as "powerful" as they could be without being able to exist as an instance.
- General agreement that the concept of an "instance" is probably "core" to the Accord Project, but signing and digital identity are outer layer / higher level challenges.
- Already have issues raised around Accord Project instance file format etc.
- Need people to contribute code or raise PRs or submit proposals for how to create "building blocks".
- As this is core, then can be handled by the Tecnology Working Group.
- Focus to be on defining and developing the instance, and then can look at how these instances can be signed.
- Potential for the Accord Project contract instance for becoming "the standard" for Smart Legal Contract interchange / exchange between platforms - e.g. Clause.io, DocuSign, beNEXT, etc...

### Replacement of Moment.js [Issue #15](https://github.com/accordproject/technical-steering-committee/issues/15)

- Being handled by Tecnology Working Group.
- Raised with TSC as this is a substantial change and to bring to TSCs attention.

### Next TSC Meeting

- Due to US Thanksgiving holiday, the 26-Nov meeting has been rescheduled to 03-Dec.
- Due to New Years Eve, the 31-Dec meeting has been canceled.
