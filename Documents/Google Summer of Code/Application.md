# Google Summer of Code Application

## Organization Application

### Your details

#### Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?
This is an excellent opportunity to inspire young developers to write code and participate in open source projects for the benefit of everyone. Even more, it is a chance to give more opportunity to developers who wish to be a part of open source communities and participate in the new and cutting-edge domain of smart legal contracts, for which the Linux Foundation’s Accord Project is the only open source community.

The Accord Project was highly energized by participation through Hacktoberfest in 2019, so we are looking for even more of a wider development community. We have put a lot of effort into making our community and codebase accessible, and have a mature yet new, nascent, and interesting opportunity to share with others.

We think that our project will interface with many other professions besides just coding, and will further provide a platform for student(s) to be a part of shaping it.

#### What would your org consider to be a successful summer?
New contributors, new features completed, more code written, better being able to guide new developers into open source world

#### How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?
`Number`

#### How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?
Regular calls, Slack, opportunities for demos to the OS community throughout the duration of the summer. We will make sure to solidify a plan with the student(s) first thing in regard to communication, and see what works best for both parties.

#### How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?
Depending on the student(s) and the project, we will jointly decide between daily and weekly reports and check-ins.

#### How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?
The Accord Project holds weekly technical calls for maintainers and for the user community. There is an active Slack organization with multiple channels. These channels  are open and the student(s) are strongly encouraged to participate in such activities to have opportunity to discuss with the rest of the community.

#### How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?
The Accord Project welcomes all OSS contributions on an ongoing basis. The student(s), if interested, will have opportunities to keep collaborating or contributing after GSoC. The student(s) will have the possibility to attend other Accord Project events (forum, and meetups). This is all in addition to the aforementioned weekly technical calls which the student(s) will be encouraged to participate in.

### Descriptions

#### Short Description:
Linux Foundation’s open source project for smart legal contracts.

#### Long Description:
A leading Linux Foundation open source initiative developing an ecosystem and open source tools for smart agreements. Smart agreements promise to reduce friction and transaction costs in the creation and management of contracts and commercial relationships. Enabling this future requires the necessary tools to format, share, execute, and manage legally enforceable machine-readable agreements. establishes and maintains a technology neutral foundation for smart legal contracts. The goal is to provide universal technology and tooling that introduces a common format for smart agreements, reducing the need to adopt and learn different technologies and future-proofing templates. Moreover, this facilitates the use of executable agreements across any infrastructure: cloud, blockchain, IoT. Furthermore, Accord Project provides domain specific functionality, meaning it is purposely designed and engineered for building and running commercial agreements, not generic applications.

### Proposals

#### Application Instructions
Review our list of projects (LINK), or come up with your own. Get in touch with the organization, community, and mentor. Tell us why you're interested in a project, what your expectations are, and discuss what you do and do not understand about the project. It will be very helpful to review our documentation. We would be happy to suggest resources early to prepare some background knowledge for writing a good proposal. If this is already sorted, still introduce yourself to the community.

If submitting an original proposal, ensure someone in the organization can competently mentor you, it is a narrow enough scope, and is coherent, realistic, innovative, and useful. Do not necessarily be deterred by any lack of preferred skills we list on a project. 

The project proposal should contain a detailed description of the project, deliverables, related work, benefits, and a timeline. It should also contain contact and biographical information, as well as previous projects (if any). Feel free to share the proposal in the community for feedback before submitting a final draft.
